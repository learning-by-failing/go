GOlang features
---
* system language
* automatic garbage collector
* only ~25 keywords
* cross platform
* compile language (like C but simpler)
* strongly typed
* supports type inference: i.e. `a := 5.5` would be automatically declared like float.
* case sensitive -> only functions with the first capital letters are exported 

### Workspace
We need three folder:
* **source** folder where put the code
* **package** folder where put any package
* **bin** folder for any compile program

**The whole code of Go functions are inside src directory in [Go repository](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src)**

## commands
* `go run {gofile.go}`
